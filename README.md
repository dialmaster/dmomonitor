# DMO Monitor

## Overview

This package is designed to be used in conjunction with `DynMiner2.exe` to facilitate showing the current status 
of running miners, including their hashrate, submits, rejects and accepts. It can also be used to notity via
Telegram when a miner stops reporting in.

It has additional functionality to accept Wallet names and connect to a fullnode to give reporting on 
mining statistics. This additional functionality is really only useful for solo mining at this time.


## Files

This contains binaries for both Windows and Linux for the monitoring program.
It also contains a Windows ONLY build of the 2.05 `DynMiner2.exe` and `dyn_miner2.cl` for use with this monitor.
Once these changes are integrated into the dynamo foundation miner, this will no longer need my provided build.

**Windows:** dmo-monitor.exe

**Linux:** dmo-monitor

## Setup

In order to set this up, there are only a few things you need to do:

1. Copy `config.yaml` to `myconfig.yaml`. Edit/setup the `myconfig.yaml`
   configuration file with your specific config. There are notes in the
   configuration file that you can use as a guide for doing this.
2. Make sure you are using a version of `DynMiner2.exe` that supports reporting.
   I have included a version built from the Foundation 2.05 in this repo for
   Windows. You will need to ensure that you use the `dyn_miner2.cl` that is
   included with it as well.
3. You will likely need to open the port in your firewall that you configure
   the dmo-monitor to use. The default is 11235 If you want to access it from
   outside your local network (away from home), then you will need to forward that
   port on your router to the machine that is running dmo-monitor as well.

## Telegram notification setup

You can receive realtime notifications when your miners go offline via telegram.
To set this up simply:
* Message /start to @dmo_monitor_bot
* Message /start to @userinfobot to get your telegram user id
* Put your telegram user id in myconfig.yaml


## Usage

1. Once you have setup `myconfig.yaml`, you can simply run dmo-monitor in a console
   window. It uses ANSI codes for formatting, so I recommend you use a terminal
   application that supports them, but it is not required. You can run the
   dmo-monitor without setting up your miners or anything else, but at that
   point it won't start reporting anything.
2. When you run your `DynMiner2.exe` program you will just need to pass 2
   additional command line options in order to connect to the dmo-monitor: The
   URL for your monitoring program and a 'vanity name' to display in the
   monitor, eg these are the two additional parameters to add to your
   `DynMiner2.exe` line: `-statrpcurl http://123.456.789.111:11235/minerstats
   -minername TestMiner`

So the full line would look like:

```
DynMiner2.exe -mode solo -server http://192.168.1.169:6433 -user username -pass password -wallet dy1qvesdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfefczsvf -miner GPU,16384,8,0,0 -statrpcurl http://192.168.1.133:11235/minerstats -minername TestMiner
```

The `-statrpcurl` argument should use the IP address of the machine the dmo-monitor is running on and the port configured for that dmo-monitor in `config.yaml`. The '/minerstats' part of the url must be left as-is

Once you run the executable it will immediately start to display statistics in the console. 

You can also access a webview that is mobile friendly by visiting your server IP address/port 
from the machine that is running dmo-monitor via:
http://localhost:11235/ 
(11235 is the default port setup in the included config, but you can change it to whatever you like)

You can also access this view from other computers or phones by using the IP address for the computer it is running dmo-monitor.
This will look like (as an example if you are accessing it from the another device on the same local network):
http://192.168.1.150:11235/

If you want to access it from outside your house, you will need to have
forwarded the port on your router and then you would access it using the IP
address assigned by your ISP.

## NOTES

Displaying Wallet Statistics:

If you want to display statistics on your mining wallets, the WalletsToMonitor will need to be Wallet Names that are setup on 
the full node you are mining against. There is no support for pool mining for these statistics yet. 
There is no support for using receiving addresses yet either.

IF ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS MONITOR YOUR ACTIVE MINERS and their hashrates, submits, rejects and accepts, 
then you should just leave the WalletsToMonitor config option BLANK like:
```
WalletsToMonitor: 
```

## Compiling
